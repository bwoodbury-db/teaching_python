# Lesson 3
In the last lesson we went over looping, in this lesson I want to go over looping through a large dataset. It's worthwhile to note that I think this may stretch them, it may be a lot quickly. 

## What do I need to teach to get the ball rolling? 
- loading in the dataset with JSON
- You load json in as a dictionary
- Dictionary notation
  - dictionary_object["key"]

## Assignment 
- Figure out the ratio of Male to Female penguins
- Average Body mass by species
- Average flipper length across all penguins


## Next week
Working on pulling in data from an API and aggregating and normalizing the data
