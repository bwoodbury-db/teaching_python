# Write a program that writes the following, in order, to the console:
# 1. "Hello World!"
# 2. Write each item from the list "abc" on it's own line, include whether it's a string or int in the printout. You can use f-string syntax: f"{variable}"
# 3. "Goodbye World!"
# #
# Constraints:
# - Use a function for both "Hello World!" and "Goodbye World!"
# - Use a loop to print each letter and number.
##
# Help:
# you can check the type against "str" or "int" with "type == str" and "type == int"
# #
# Reach out to Brennan or Gerald for help as needed. We're here and eager to help!
